These contain data in the form of a register of transactions. The whole is secured by a system of connections between blocks created using cryptographic methods. Subsequent segments are connected to each other in a chain. Each block contains not only an individual set of data, but also fragments of information from the block preceding and following it. In this way, data is dispersed throughout the chain. This makes transactions involving cryptocurrencies extremely secure. Breaking the chain of blocks, even in pure theory, seems practically impossible, as it would require the use of computers with huge computational parameters. The technology on which most cryptocurrencies are based. Each record, or block, contains a record of transactions that are secured and linked using cryptographic techniques. In practice, this means that there is no single place to store data, and every user of the network has a complete record of transactions.",
